# MPT Documentation

These templates can be used by any project team so that they have the requisite documentation for optimal use of the MPT as well as for audits or other reviews.

The folder structure follows the structure that should be used to keep each file organized. The structure is as follows:

## 1 Procurement Package

[This folder](https://github.com/GSA/CoE-MPT-process/blob/master/Documentation/1-Procurement-Package/) contains all of the information the project team will need to submit to get a MPT buy started. It also contains all of the information the acquisition team will need to verify the MPT buy is ready to get started.

## 2 Issue Package

[This folder](https://github.com/GSA/CoE-MPT-process/blob/master/Documentation/2-Issue-Package/) contains all of the information the acquisition team will need to run a competition using the MPT.

## 3 Award Package
