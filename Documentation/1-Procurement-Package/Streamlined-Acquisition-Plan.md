# CoE MPP | {{User-Story-Title}}
## Streamlined Acquisition Plan

The purpose of this streamlined acquisition plan is to provide an overall summary of the {{User-Story-Title}} requirement, being fulfilled through the CoE MPP. The {{Project-Team}} needs to purchase the services of a contractor to assist them with completing this need.

## Background
### The project
> Please replace this line with the exact same content under the same section of the Market Research Report.

### The user story/stories
> Please replace this line with the actual user story or user stories that are the subject of this MPP buy.

## Special considerations
> Please replace this line with any special considerations for the acquisition. Examples include:
> * This is a highly visible project (e.g., it involves something like [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/)-related work)
> * This involves a mission-critical application (e.g., this involves work for [login.gov](https://login.gov/) or [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/))
> * This is a new type of requirement that hasn't been done before (e.g., [TTS Bug Bounty](https://github.com/18F/tts-buy-bug-bounty))
> * This is a complex requirement (e.g., it involves [new technology](https://github.com/GSA/coe-discovery-bpa) like artificial intelligence or robotic process automation)
> If the project doesn’t have any special considerations, simply state that this section is not applicable.
