### Results
> Please replace this line with a couple of detailed paragraphs that outline everything you learned from the market research performed, explaining how you ended up with the characteristics of an ideal contractor and  why you believe that will be what is required to complete this user story/these user stories successfully.

Finally, the results of the market research, as outlined above, has allowed {{Project-Team}} to determine that the government’s needs can be met through an offering customarily available in the commercial marketplace, without any modifications.

### Sources
Due to the fact {{User-Story-Title}} can be completed within a sprint, is unique and discrete, and fits within the micro-purchase threshold, the government’s use of the MPT will allow for the most cost effective and technically capable contractors to propose and provide a solution. This will allow {{Project-Team}} to obtain bids from a wide variety of contractors, espousing Full and Open Competition with No Set-Aside Used. Due to the potential value of an award for {{User-Story-Title}}, it is uniquely designed to be completely accessible to small and disadvantaged businesses.

### Price
Using the reasoning outlined in the independent government cost estimate (IGCE), {{User-Story-Title}}, the estimated cost is $VALUE.00. This estimate is also the fair market value (FMV) for such a requirement.

### Customary terms and conditions
Development of work associated with {{User-Story-Title}} would customarily be provided on either an hourly basis or a fixed rate. {{Project-Team}} has scoped {{User-Story-Title}} to be explicitly clear and defined enough to utilize a fixed rate.
